### Ackownledgement

Thanks to the System-Level-Design Group in Columbia University led by Prof Luca Carloni
for providing as the examples

### Overview

This is an example to show the verification of different implementations according to our ILA 
specification. The two implementations are in SystemC and Verilog. 

### Directories

The two implementations are in 
* SystemC
* Verilog

And,

* ILA contains our ILA model, and the refinement relations
* util contains the supporting library for building and translating refinement relations

The two directories:
* SysCV and
* VerilogV contain the wrappers and scripts for verification

### Tools

In addition to our ILA tools, we make use of CBMC and JasperGold for model checking.
