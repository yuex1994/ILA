This is to verify each round of two AES implementation.  This is about functional equivalence.

C/Verilog directory contains the part of ILA vs. C/Verilog verification
ILA vs. ILA verification can be done by ILA tool or by JasperGold (the latter
is much faster, given it is a commercial tool)

To use ILA tool, run python EQ.py
To use JG, goto JGVerify directory
